Pointer Scanning with Cheat Engine:

      - in this video he also shows AOB injection which lets you change the assembly operations and it's saved in the cheat table.
        This is pretty nice because now you don't have to pointerscan, test pointers, etc between game sessions.
        For example, if you want an ammo cheat instead of finding the pointer to the ammo you could simply make an AOB injecton that does NOP instead           of DEC REGISTER_NAME. Unless the game is updated the cheat script will be reliable, this is not really a con since addresses also usually             change with game updates unless you have a good dumper.
      - What an AOB injection is:
              "AOB Injection and Code Injection are really the same thing except in case of AOB Injection, the injection point is scanned and found in                 the code using a specific signature (AOB = array of byte) while Code Injection uses hard-coded addresses."
